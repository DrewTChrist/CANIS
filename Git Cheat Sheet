How to setup and use Git

1. Switch to your branch.
    git checkout [your name]
    
2. Pull the latest commits from the dev branch into your branch.
    git pull origin dev
    
3. Add a new file or folder to Git.
    git add [filename]

4. Or add everything in the directory to Git.
    git add .
    
5. See which files have been modified and are staged to be pushed.
    git status
    
6. Commit your changes.
    git commit -m "Write a short message here that says what was changed or added"
    
7. Push your new commit to your branch. (Important to always push to your own branch and not dev or master!)
    git push origin [your name]
    
8. Repeat steps 2-7 when you want to make additions to the project.
